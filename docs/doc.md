### Purpose
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development and understanding of the software project titled "parking-app".

### Audience
The intended audience of this document includes project stakeholders, developers, testers, and anyone involved in the project lifecycle.

### Introduction
(Introduce the software project, its goals, and the problem it aims to solve)
parking-app is an application that helps users conveniently find and reserve parking spots in advance, reducing the time spent searching for parking. The system provides real-time availability updates, secure reservations, and user-friendly payment options.

### Project Overview
"parking-app" is a web-based inventory management system designed for small businesses. It streamlines inventory tracking, order management, and reporting.
### Project Goals
- Improve inventory accuracy.
- Enhance order fulfillment efficiency.
- Provide real-time reporting capabilities.

## Glossary
(Define key terms and acronyms used throughout the document, unless they are commonly known to each possible stakeholder (e.g., “Cell phone”) AND used with their common meaning. Do not expect your stakeholders to be experts. If in doubt, define a term.)
- Inventory: The stock of products available for sale.
- SKU: Stock Keeping Unit, a unique identifier for each product.
- API: Application Programming Interface.

 
## User Requirements and Use Cases
(Outline what the system must do from the user's perspective. User stories need to use the format discussed in class and on our slides. Use cases provide detailed scenarios of system interactions.)

### User Stories
(A collection of user stories that apply to the project.)


1.	As a registered user, I want to log in securely so that I cannot be held responsible for someone else’s actions.
2.	As a user, I want to search for avaialable parking spots so that I can easily find a place to park.
3.	As a user, I want to reserve a parking spot so that I am guaranteed a space until arrival.
4.	As a parking lot owner, I want to automatically update the availability of parking sports so that users see up to date information.
5.	As a user, I want to extend my parking time remotely so that I dont get fined.
6.	As a user, I want to view my reservation history so that I can keep track of my parking expenses.
